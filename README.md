# HappyColouring_SBM
Finding feasible happy colouring for networks generated in the Stochastic Block Model

The graphs and functions are generated for the research "Soft happy colourings and community structure of networks" available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15663.

The functions are available in Support.py.

To generate instances, read or write them in DIMACS format, use genSBM.py
